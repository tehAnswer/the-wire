# the-wire

A minimalistic do-it-for-the-lolz app named after one of the HBO classic television show whose main purpose is to keep track of the modifications of the users status of a given Slack team by posting them into a designated channel.

Currently, the Slack messages sent by this application falls in two different categories depending on the event which triggered it: unsetting state vs updating state as the figure shown below indicates.
